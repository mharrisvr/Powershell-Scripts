# Powershell-Scripts

# Here is where I plan on uploading all of the powershell Scripts I write as part of a quick lab setup / Other various tasks that I end up writing scripts to take care. 


Projects planned to add out: 
*PS Script to create multiple VMs of different OS and systems specs to quickly setup lab environments. (7/15/21). 
*Will need to go back into this script and setup Virtual network switch so that all VMs can communicate.. at some point. 
*Configure custom Win 10 / Server 2016 image to bypass OOBE setup (Microsoft MDT) and then script configuration and build out of Active Directory environment. 
*Possibly turning all of that into a PS module for easier use. 
*Porting to VMWare for use with PowerCLI.
